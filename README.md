# RLGameGui
Resolution independent gui for raylib.

RLGameGui is designed as a simple screen based UI for in game HUDs panels and menus. It is not designed as a windowing system, or for use as an editor (RayGui is better at that). RLGameGui works by defining nested UI elements that are anchored to parts of the screen.
